This Project is an Wiper control (WCS) system,a wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.It useful in the automotive unit the main purpose of the system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.

## Identifying features
* When the button is pressed once the car will start (Ignition key postion at ACC)
* When the button is pressed again the wiper will start(Wiper On)
* When the button is pressed again the wiper will off(Wiper Off)
* When the button is pressed thrice the car will stop(Ignition key position at Lock)
## State of art
* The main focus point is seeing the wiper control of the car.
* And also seeing the seep of the wiper system in the car
* Now this two features are explained in these project
## 5W's & 1H and S.W.O.T analysis is in the below table
# | 5W's & 1H |
*What
-- wiper control system (WCS)

*Where --Inside and out side the car

*When
--When the weather condition is bad (like in rain and snow) the wiper is activate and clean the car window

*Who
--Who is driving or controlling the car

*How
--By using STM like by multiple pushes on a button

# | S.W.O.T ANALYSIS |
Strengths

* No human interaction with car

* Manages all commands with one key automatically

* encryption in data Weaknesses

* Unable to monitor status of car

* Range is limited

* Wait for certain time after every command to press new command Opportunities

* The Scope of this sytem is huge in car control

* can be used where the car need thesed command

* Less cost Threats

* When new command is given without completing the current command it will not take current command
