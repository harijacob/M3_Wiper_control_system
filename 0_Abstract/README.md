# INTRODUCTION
Car glass that is exposed to dirt or rainwater will usually be cleaned using a wiper. usually, the wiper is attached to the front and rear sides with the wiper, the driver's view will not be hindered and so they can see clearly towards the front or rear. Wipers do have a very important role in the safety of the drivers because wiper performance is closely releated to the safety of driving. If it is rains a lot and the car does'nt use wipers windshield will be dewy. Visible dew on the glass will block the view of the driver. When the driver's view is hindered, the risk of an accident is very high. This makes the wipers a very important car enchancement and must be present on all types of vehicles.

# Features
* Most wipers have a low and a high speed, as well as an intermittent setting. When the wipers are on low and high speed, the motor runs continuously.
* But in the intermittent setting, the wipers stop momentarily between each wipe. There are many different kinds of switches for wipers.
* Some cars have just one intermittent speed, others have 10 discrete settings and still others have a sliding scale that can be set for almost any time interval.
 
# Working
Whichever kind of controls your car has, setting them just right can be tricky -- too fast and the windshield gets dry and the wipers squeak; too slow and your visibility is blocked by raindrops. Compounding this is the fact that the amount of water hitting the windshield changes as your car speeds up and slows down. It can require almost constant attention to keep the wipers operating properly. Carmakers may finally have conquered this problem with the holy grail of wiper technology -- the rain-sensing wiper
